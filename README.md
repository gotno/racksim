This repository is the Unreal Engine side of [VCVRVR](https://blog.gotno.net/vcvrvr).

Feel free to file any bugs or feature requests over in [issues](https://github.com/gotno/racksim/issues).

## Things to know
1. You should have the latest version of Rack (> v2.5) installed. RackSim will use your plugins and settings.
2. You **should not** have Rack running before starting RackSim. RackSim needs to manage its own custom version of Rack. It will not work if Rack is already running.
3. Any new plugins or plugin updates will need to be handled by starting your installed Rack and letting it run updates.
4. RackSim will keep its own seperate autosave directory (`autosave-racksim`) and template patch (`template-racksim.vcv`)
